# ppop-funds

This is a static website build with Hugo for fundraising I've done during war in Ukraine for Kharkiv special
purpose police regiment.

Website is hosted at: <https://fund.suddengunter.com/> and served via CloudFlare Pages.

Reporting was done manualy during the fundraising, but I've wrote some short elixir app to do it post-factum (found a
few errors in old manual report). Reporting tool is located at <https://github.com/SuddenGunter/ppop-report>.
